# Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) is to outline the acceptable use of the organization's IT resources, including computers, networks, and internet access. This policy is designed to prevent misuse and ensure that employees understand their responsibilities.

## 2. Scope

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, consultants, temporary and other workers at the organization, including all personnel affiliated with third parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by the organization.

## 3. Policy

### 3.1 General Use and Ownership

- The organization's IT resources are provided for business purposes. Limited personal use is permitted as long as it does not interfere with work responsibilities or productivity.
- Users are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the reasonableness of personal use.
- For security and network maintenance purposes, authorized individuals within the organization may monitor equipment, systems, and network traffic at any time.

### 3.2 Security and Proprietary Information

- All users must keep passwords secure and not share accounts. Authorized users are responsible for the security of their passwords and accounts.
- All PCs, laptops, and workstations should be secured with a password-protected screensaver with the automatic activation feature set to 10 minutes or less.
- Postings by employees from an organization email address to newsgroups should contain a disclaimer stating that the opinions expressed are strictly their own and not necessarily those of the organization, unless posting is in the course of business duties.

### 3.3 Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need to disable the network access of a host if that host is disrupting production services).

Under no circumstances is an employee of the organization authorized to engage in any activity that is illegal under local, state, federal, or international law while utilizing organization-owned resources.

The lists below are by no means exhaustive but attempt to provide a framework for activities that fall into the category of unacceptable use.

#### 3.3.1 System and Network Activities

The following activities are strictly prohibited:

- Violations of the rights of any person or company protected by copyright, trade secret, patent, or other intellectual property, or similar laws or regulations.
- Unauthorized copying of copyrighted material including, but not limited to, digitization and distribution of photographs from magazines, books, or other copyrighted sources, copyrighted music, and the installation of any copyrighted software for which the organization or the end user does not have an active license.
- Accessing data, a server, or an account for any purpose other than conducting organization business, even if you have authorized access, is prohibited.
- Exporting software, technical information, encryption software, or technology in violation of international or regional export control laws is illegal. The appropriate management should be consulted prior to export of any material that is in question.
- Introduction of malicious programs into the network or server (e.g., viruses, worms, Trojan horses, e-mail bombs, etc.).
- Revealing your account password to others or allowing use of your account by others. This includes family and other household members when work is being done at home.
- Using an organization computing asset to actively engage in procuring or transmitting material that is in violation of sexual harassment or hostile workplace laws in the user's local jurisdiction.
- Making fraudulent offers of products, items, or services originating from any organization account.
- Making statements about warranty, expressly or implied, unless it is a part of normal job duties.
- Effecting security breaches or disruptions of network communication. Security breaches include, but are not limited to, accessing data of which the employee is not an intended recipient or logging into a server or account that the employee is not expressly authorized to access unless these duties are within the scope of regular duties. For purposes of this section, "disruption" includes, but is not limited to, network sniffing, pinged floods, packet spoofing, denial of service, and forged routing information for malicious purposes.
- Port scanning or security scanning is expressly prohibited unless prior notification to IT is made.
- Executing any form of network monitoring which will intercept data not intended for the employee's host, unless this activity is a part of the employee's normal job/duty.
- Circumventing user authentication or security of any host, network, or account.
- Interfering with or denying service to any user other than the employee's host (for example, denial of service attack).
- Using any program/script/command, or sending messages of any kind, with the intent to interfere with, or disable, a user's terminal session, via any means, locally or via the internet/intranet/extranet.
- Providing information about, or lists of, organization employees to parties outside the organization.

### 3.4 Email and Communication Activities

- Sending unsolicited email messages, including the sending of "junk mail" or other advertising material to individuals who did not specifically request such material (email spam).
- Any form of harassment via email, telephone, or paging, whether through language, frequency, or size of messages.
- Unauthorized use, or forging, of email header information.
- Solicitation of email for any other email address, other than that of the poster's account, with the intent to harass or to collect replies.
- Creating or forwarding "chain letters", "Ponzi", or other "pyramid" schemes of any type.
- Use of unsolicited email originating from within the organization's networks of other internet/intranet/extranet service providers on behalf of, or to advertise, any service hosted by the organization or connected via the organization's network.
- Posting the same or similar non-business-related messages to large numbers of Usenet newsgroups (newsgroup spam).

## 4. Policy Compliance
